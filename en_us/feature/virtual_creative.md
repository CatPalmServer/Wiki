# Simulation of Creative Mode
Allows for quick destruction of blocks and acquiring of items, similar to creative mode.

## Extraction
Equivalent to extracting items from `/backpack`, there are several ways to do so:
- Extract from creative mode interface
- Select in `/item`
- Click middle mouse button in backpack
- Click middle mouse button on a block in the world
- Use up item in hand

## Storage
Equivalent to storing items in `/backpack`, there are several ways to do so:
- Press `X` in backpack
- Drop into creative mode interface

### Destruction
Instantly destroys a block and drops items, at a cost of `hardness` x `2.0` experience points. When holding a tool, durability can be consumed to reduce experience cost by `1` and prioritize the tool's enchantment effects.
