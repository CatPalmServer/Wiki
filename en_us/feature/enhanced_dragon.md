## Data

## Behavior
### Current level
Health is divided into 10 segments, each representing 10% of the total health. The level formula is 10 x Rounded Down (Remaining Health / 200), which results in levels 1-10. When the level increases by 1, all crystals are re-summoned.
### Explosion beam
Explosion beams are generated in a radius of 20 blocks around the central point of (0,0) in the End, up to a limit of 14 + the dragon's level. Each beam lasts for 56 seconds and travels in a random direction every 3-10 seconds. Players within 6 blocks take (7.0 + 0.1 x level) x (1.0 x (distance x 2.0) / 4.0) damage.
### Crystal Burst
When a crystal is destroyed, 10 explosion beams are generated within a radius of 4 blocks. They gradually move towards the central point of (0,0) until they reach it, at which point 20 explosion beams are generated within a radius of 14 blocks.
